- what is recursion?
  technique in which a solution of a big problem is dependant on solution of sub problems inside of it
 

 - what do we need to achieve a recursive function?
   -- a base case which would stop the recursive calls
   --recursive calls inside of that function
  
 - Iteration VS recursion
 -- any iterative function could be recursive instead
  --recursion --> elegant, more readable (idk how come), less code
  -- recursion --> calling function is more memory  consuming than loops



  - time complexity
