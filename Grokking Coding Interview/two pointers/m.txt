Ideas:
-sorted array --> two pointers


Questions:
 1- Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.
    could be solved in two ways:
     1- sorted--> hash table, two pointers t-c: o(n) s-c: o(1)
     2- not sorted --> hash table (two sum leetcode) t-c: o(n) s-c: o(n )



2 - Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates from it. You should not use any extra space; after removing the duplicates in-place return the new length of the array.
